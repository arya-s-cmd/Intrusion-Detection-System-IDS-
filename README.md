#Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

##Overview

The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security application designed to monitor network traffic and alert system administrators of any suspicious or unauthorized activity. This project leverages computer vision techniques and real-time monitoring to enhance security.

The IDS is implemented using Python, OpenCV for image processing, and Twilio for sending alerts. It utilizes the CVZone library's PoseDetector to detect human presence and triggers SMS notifications when suspicious activity is detected.

##Features

- Real-time monitoring of network traffic or camera feed
- Human presence detection using PoseDetector
- SMS alert system for notifying administrators of suspicious activities
- Easy integration with Twilio API for sending notifications

##Technologies

- Python: Programming language used for the implementation
- OpenCV: Library for computer vision tasks such as image processing and object detection
- CVZone: Library for pose detection
- Twilio: Service for sending SMS alerts
- cv2: OpenCV module for video capture and processing
